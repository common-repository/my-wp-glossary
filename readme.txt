A glossary block for your WordPress website, with structured data and powered by a Gutenberg block or a shortcode.

== Description ==

This plugin make it really simple to add a glossary page to your website.

It uses Schema.org `DefinedTermSet` structured data for better search engine optimization (SEO) of your definitions list.

Once you definition terms are ready, you can easily include them into a glossary page using our Glossary block for Gutenberg (or the `[glossary]` shortcode if you‚Äôre not using Gutenberg yet).

Plus, this plugin will automatically add a link to the related glossary definitions each time the term appears in all your posts and pages. This is super helpful for your internal linking.

By default, this plugin use a very minimal amount of CSS styles (so it works well on all WordPress themes!), but it provides all the CSS classes you‚Äôll need to style it on your own :)
